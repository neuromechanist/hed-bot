The setting features white subway tiles on the lower walls, accented by a horizontal band of black tiles, while the upper walls are painted a neutral beige. A white, wall-mounted sink with a chrome faucet sits beneath a large mirror framed in dark wood, which reflects a doorway and a glimpse of a bulletin board. Above the mirror, a dual-light fixture with warm, glowing bulbs provides bright, even illumination. To the left of the sink, a stainless steel trash can and a paper towel dispenser are mounted on the wall. On the right, a white baby changing station is installed, featuring a blue circular decal with a teddy bear and the words \"Cubs Care,\" indicating a family-friendly environment. A bottle of orange hand soap rests on the sink's edge. The overall composition is balanced and practical, with a focus on cleanliness and accessibility, using a color palette of white, beige, black, and warm yellow light to create a welcoming and functional atmosphere.",
