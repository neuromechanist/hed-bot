The deviant tone (1200 Hz) and the standard tones (800 Hz) are correctly represented as distinct stimuli, with the temporal relationship expressed using (After, (Tone, Frequency/800 Hz)), which reasonably conveys that the deviant occurs after a sequence of standard tones.  \n\nThe semantic grouping is correct: frequency values are properly nested within their respective tone events, ensuring clarity that each tone has a specific frequency. The structure allows for a reversible translation back into natural language: \u201cAn oddball auditory stimulus\u2014a tone at 1200 Hz\u2014is presented after a sequence of 800 Hz tones,\u201d which closely matches the original meaning.  \n\nNo refinement is needed.
